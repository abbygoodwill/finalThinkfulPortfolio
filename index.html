  <h2>What are my hobbies?</h2>
  <p>Reading and writing will forever be two of my favorite activites.  While in high school I boxed comptetively and also trained Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.  I loved the combination of physical endurance and strategy involved in both sports.  Right now I am taking a break to focus on school, but afterwards I fully intend to start training again.</p>

  <p>Ideally, I would love to develop mobile apps and also publish the book series that I am working on.</p>
