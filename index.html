      <a href="https://github.com/abbygoodwill/Hot-or-Cold-App" target="_blank" class="LinkHOCA"><h2>Hot or Cold App</h2></a>
      <p>This app is a game designed by Thinkful.  It is a game that selects a number.  Then the user has to guess the value of this number.  As the user continues to guess, the app returns the words, "hot" or "cold" based on how close the guess number is to the selected number.

    <div class="ProductFinderAPI">
      <a href="https://github.com/abbygoodwill/ProductFinderAPI" target="_blank" class="LinkProductFinderAPI"><h2>Product API Finder</h2></a>
      <p> This project works alongside the Etsy API.  It allows the user to enter in a type of product that they are looking for. Then it returns the top products with that title listed on the Etsy website.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="QuizApp">
      <a href="https://github.com/abbygoodwill/InteractiveQuizApp" target="_blank" class="LinkQuizApp"><h2>Quiz App</h2></a>
      <p>This project was based off of a quiz I had in biology.  It is a basic quiz app with 6 questions and as the user continues to do the quiz, the app will calculate the grade the user currently has based off of how many questions they have completed and gotten correct.

    <h1>Where I am From</h1>
    <p>I was born in Alabama, but I moved to Colorado when I was very young so I never picked up the accent and consider myself a Coloradoan.</p>
